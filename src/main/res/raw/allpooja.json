This is known as Pushpanjali.\nWe then wash Lord Ganesha�s feet with water and scented water (Arghya). Water is also offered as a sip to be consumed (Aachaman).\nIt is then time for Ganesh snaanam and abhishekam. The murti has to be first bathed using water and then with Panchamrut (a mix of milk, curd, ghee, honey and sugar and in that order). This is followed by application of scented oil on the murti. The final step is washing away the excess oil using Gangaajal.\nThe murti is then made to wear new Vastras and Yajnopavita or Janoyi.\nThe freshly bathed and clothed murti is then offered grains of rice i.e. akshata, then phoolmala, shaami patra, durva, sindoor,dhoop, diya and Naivedya (Prasad).\nThe final offerings include 5 leaves of Paan along with betel nuts (supari), coconuts and dakshina.\nThe Ganpati Sthapana Puja Vidhi is concluded by singing the Ganesh Aartis and chanting various Ganesh Mantras",
